# file:// repo (installation/iso/offline-repo.sh), so pacstrap and the in-chroot
# driver step install from local disk with no network at all. Active only when
# RYOKU_ONLINE != 1 AND RYOKU_OFFLINE_REPO points at a baked repo that has a
# synced db; otherwise the online path in pacstrap.sh / deploy.sh runs unchanged.
#
# The desktop set is folded into the pacstrap transaction (one pass, the way
# omarchy batches its base install) rather than a second chroot `pacman -S`, so
# an offline install is a single dependency resolution over local packages.
